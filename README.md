## About
<p>I'm excited to share with you the project I've been working on lately.



I developed a web calculator using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, taking advantage of the excellent tools provided by Visual Studio Code. The main objective of this project was to demonstrate and improve my technical skills in the world of programming.



Although I used knowledge I already had, this project gave me the opportunity to improve my previous skills. Throughout development, I was able to practice and expand my programming knowledge, further reinforcing my love for technology.</p>
